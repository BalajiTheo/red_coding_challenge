Question:

Currently there are two filters available to filter the pokemons
1. Filter by typing pokemon name in the search text box, and/or
2. Click on "My Favourites" button next to search text box - this will show only pokemons that are earlier marked as "Favourite"

Challenge is to add a new third filter that would allow filtering pokemons using "type" of the pokemons. (Info: Each pokemon is associated with a type).
Use any UI elements as you wish to show the type filter (But if you like there are SVGs for pokemon types, in the src/assets folder)
-- question ends here----
